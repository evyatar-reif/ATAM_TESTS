This is a simple text file with short lines of content.
Each line will be limited to sixty characters only.
We can write about anything in this small format.
Maybe describe a sunny day or a cold rainy night.
The purpose is to stay within the length constraint.
No line should go over sixty characters at all.
This keeps things neat and easy to read and scan.
It could be a poem, a note, or part of a story.
Short lines are also great for older terminals.
You can even write messages for fun like this one.
